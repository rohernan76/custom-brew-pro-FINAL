	description: "Low in alcohol and refreshingly tart, and often served with a flavored syrup like Woodruff or raspberry, this German-style wheat ale presents a harmony between yeast and lactic acid. These beers are very pale in color, and may be cloudy as they are often unfiltered. Hops are not a feature of this style, but these beers often do showcase esters. Traditional versions often showcase Brettanomyces yeast. Growing in popularity in the U.S., where many brewers are now adding traditional and exotic fruits to the recipe, resulting in flavorful finishes with striking, colorful hues. These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and residual sugar are very low, allowing the beerâ€™s acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine. Carbonation is very high, adding to the refreshment factor this style delivers. Many examples of this style contain no hops and thus no bitterness at all.",

Low-level roasted malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with low to medium malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low to medium-high. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. The addition of rye to a beer can add a spicy or pumpernickel character to the flavor and finish. Color can also be enhanced and may become more red from the use of rye. The ingredient has come into vogue in recent years in everything from stouts to lagers, but is especially popular with craft brewers in India pale ales. To be considered an example of the style, the grain bill should include sufficient rye such that rye character is evident in the beer.",

I homebrewed this particular batch at a time when I thought that the idea of Trump running for the highest office of the land was absolutely ludicrous. Little did I know he would snag the nomination for the GOP a few months later. By brewing this beer, I may have jinxed the whole nation! Anyway, the title 'Imperial' conveys two things. First, 'imperial' is an indication that the beer is big, bold, and beautiful regardless of the style. The hops and malts used during brewing are doubled or even tripled, and the resulting beer can pack quite an alcoholic punch ranging from 8% to 12% ABV. Second, since Trump is such an egomaniac and imperial pig, I figured that this name was perfect! Happy drinking and here's a toast to a bright future without Drumpf has our President!",

The name 'Freedom Fawn' says it all: this boy busted out of a bad situation in Utah and ended up with us. He found his freedom and now sleeps like a fawn. He deserves the best retirement. Obviously the beer is a blonde ale which is a great beer to drink in the hot days of summer. The Blonde Ale is also known as a Golden Ale--these beers are often referred to as a starter ale for those new to craft brewing because it is the closest style to a lager in the ale family. They are light yellow to deep gold in color and are clear. Overall flavor is subdued (by comparison to other ales) and usually has a mild malt sweetness. Malts can also provide a mild biscuity or toasty flavor. Low to medium hop flavor and bitterness. Overall this is a lawnmower beer that is most commonly found in American brewpubs, although English Summer Ales and other beers also fit in this category.",
