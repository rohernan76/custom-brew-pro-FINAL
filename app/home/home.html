            <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">I love beer, and I made this website because I enjoy the special craft we call homebrewing. I’m assuming that since you are visiting my website, you love beer as well! Well, there’s only one thing I can think of better than drinking beer: brewing beer for you!! I’ve had the thought of brewing beer for family and friends for the better part of five years, but it has never come to fruition. That changed last summer when I had a very close friend approach me to brew beer for their wedding. Since I had done it for my own wedding, I figured this is something I could turn into a side business. So this summer the first step in that direction was designing this website with the incredible support from CodeCraft, particularly Erty "Pizarro" Seidol and Sarah "Strong Crutch" Huynh! I hope you continue to explore my website and contact me if you have any questions. Cheers!</p>
